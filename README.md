# Carsharing Application â€” Microservices Demo with .NET Aspire ( work-in-progress)

## 1. Introduction
The main purpose of this repository is to build a carsharing application to demonstrate microservices architecture, Clean Architecture, and the CQRS pattern, implemented using the .NET Aspire development stack.
The application consists of:
- Two microservices: Users and Rides
- A web frontend developed with Angular 19
- Asynchronous communication between services via RabbitMQ
- Identity and access management handled through Keycloak

Each service exposes REST APIs, and there are example requests in the Postman collection: Docs/Postman collection/Car sharing.postman_collection.json.
